</ol>

<h3>STARTING THE APPLICATION</h3>

<p>To start application, follow the next steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Go to "03 Application" folder.

First, you have to start server, and then clients, so that client can connect to the server. 
</p>
</li>
<li>

Start server by running "03 Application/Server/FlameChatServer.exe".
Two windows will appear, IP Address Chooser window and Server Messages. In IP Address Chooser choose one of listed IPs. In the text field, type SQL Server instance id. This is needed for connection string for access to database. After clicking OK, a dialog box will appear and when you click OK in the dialog, server will start on the chosen IP address and no further interactions with server will be needed. Server Messages will show logs from server, so you can follow what is going on. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Start clients:</p>
<p>
Copy client directory "03 Application/Client 1" to this or any other folder as many times as you need clients.

Several windows will open when you start client. Please, start clients one by one and login to each before moving to the next.
