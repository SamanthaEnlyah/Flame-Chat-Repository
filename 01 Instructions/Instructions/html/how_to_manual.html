<h2 class="mx-auto">Manual: How to</h2>
<br>
<h3 class="mx-auto">I Data</h3>

<h4 class="mx-auto">Creating a database and inserting records</h4>
</br>

<p>Open SQL Server management studio and create a database called flamechat.</p>
<p>Go to File -> Open -> File...</p>
<p>Select "02 Data/tables_and_records.sql".</p>
<p>Right click inside query text -> Execute. This will run the sql query.</p>
<p>SQL query will create tables and insert some data. </p>
<p>Data contains 11 users who have contacts and personality traits (over 650 traits are in db) and have exchanged some messages.</p>
<p id="usernames">List of users is in "02 Data/usernames.xlsx" file, which you can use to login. </p>
 
</br>
<h3 class="mx-auto">II Running</h3>
</br>
<p>Compiled Server and Client are in folder "03 Application".</p>
<p><img style="display: inline" src="../images/server.png">Server is in 03 Application/Server/net9.0-windows/FlameChatServer.exe</p>
<p><img style="display: inline" src="../images/flame.png">Client 1 is in 03 Application/Client 1/net9.0-windows/FlameChatClient.exe</p>
<p><img style="display: inline" src="../images/flame.png">Client 2 is in 03 Application/Client 2/net9.0-windows/FlameChatClient.exe</p>
<p>You have to allow all .exe. files to go over private network.</p>

<h4 class="mx-auto">1. Server</h4>

<p>Server must be started before clients.</p>
<p>Start the server.</p>
<p>When starting Server, IP Address Chooser window will appear. You need to select an IP Address from the list. You also need to type the SQL Server Express instance id. Server is the one to talk to the database, it needs this data to create connection string. Click OK to confirm your info.</p>

<h4 class="mx-auto"> 2. Client </h4>
<h5 class="mx-auto">Important note</h5>
<p>IP Address Chooser for client is appearing each time before you login and before you sign up. </p>
<p>Choose IP address before you click anything else, because, client is starting and connecting to server, and it must have an IP address. </p>
<p>Client has to be on the same network as Server.</p>
<p>Example: if server is on 192.168.40.X, then all clients have to be on 192.168.40.Y. Every client CAN be on the SAME IP ADDRESS as the Server, meaning it can have address: 192.168.40.X</p>

<h5 class="mx-auto">Running the client</h5>
<p>Start the client.</p>
<p>Click OK on Welcome dialog.</p>
<p>LogIn/SignUp Window with two buttons (LogIn and Sign Up) will appear.</p>

<h5 class="mx-auto">Use cases</h5>

<p><b>Not Logged In, want to Log In:</b> 
    <p>If you are  not logged in, choose Log In. </p>
    <p>Two windows will appear, IP Address Chooser and Log In window.  </p>
    <p>First select IP address. </p>
    <p>After that login with existing <a id="userdata" href="#usernames" class="anchor">user data</a>.</p> 
    <p>Chat window will appear.</p>
    <p>Wait for all data to be read from database, it will take about half-minute.</p>
    <p></p>
</p>    
<p><b>Not logged In, Want to Sign Up:</b> If you are  not logged in and you want to Sign up, click Sign up, and IP Address Chooser will appear together with Sign Up window. 
    Select IP on IP Chooser and click Choose. THEN you can sign up. Fill in the username and password and choose picture. Click SIgn up and wait for a minute.
    After Signing up, you will be Logged in and Chat Window will appear.</p>
<p><b>Logged in:</b> If you are already logged in, IP Address Chooser also appears at the same time as LogIn/Signup window. Select IP Address that is on the same network as Server. App will read from session/session.json file login data, and it will login and show Chat Window.</p>
<p><b>Logged In, Log in as different user:</b> If you are logged in and you want to Log in as different user, click Log Out and then click Log In.</p>
<p><b>Logged In:</b> If you logged in, Chat Window will appear.</p>
<p>Go to Profile to see data about user. Profile button is in upper left corner of Chat Window, and it is disabled at first.
    This is because the app is loading data from database via server, and you cannot access profile during that time</p>
<p>When loading is done, Profile button is enabled. Then you can go to Profile and add contacts from list of users (contacts are saved in database when added), and you can choose personality traits from list of personality traits in database (saving to database is needed for this).</p>

<p>When you are logged in, you have several options:</p>
<p>You can Add contacts, Add personality traits and Send and Receive messages.</p>
