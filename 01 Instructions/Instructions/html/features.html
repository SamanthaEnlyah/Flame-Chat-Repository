Client features:
</p>

<p>Add personality trait and add contact are done in Profile.</p>
<p>Add contacts first to be able to send messages. You have to add both participants to be each others' contacts. If Isabela Parks talks to Caden Jacobs, Caden has to be logged in and has to add Isabela as his contact. Isabela also has to be logged in and add Caden to her contacts. Otherwise, they will not see each others' messages. (This will be fixed in further versions).</p>
<p>Send message and view messages are done in Chat Window. </p>

<p>You access profile from Chat Window. In the upper left corner there is a Profile button.</p>
<p>When you login, Profile button is disabled, because the app is loading data from database via server, and you cannot access profile during that time.</p>
<p>When loading is done, Profile button is enabled. Then you can go to Profile and add contacts from list of users (contacts are saved in database when added), and you can choose personality traits from list of personality traits in database (saving to database is needed for this).</p>
